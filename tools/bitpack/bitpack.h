 * 
 * This library is a bitpacking API useful for applications that make use of
 * flags, binary packed data (networking, emulation, etc), and for the study of
 * bitwise operations and compressed data.
 *
 * The API provides methods for packing both signed and unsigned data. Packing
 * and unpacking is safe, in that the behavior for edge cases is well-defined.

/*
 *    Purpose: Check if a value n fits into the specified number of bits.
 * Parameters: A 64 bit unsigned value n, and an unsigned width (in bits).
 *    Returns: A boolean (true if n fits into width, false otherwise)
 *   Contract: It is a checked runtime error to pass a width greater than the
 *             maximum word size (64). It is also checked that width be
 *             positive.
