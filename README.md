# Representation Tools
## January 4, 2017

### Introduction
This is a basic set of C programs for studying the representation of data at the
machine level. The tools are platform-independent, and should compile and run on
any machine using a standard, ANSI C-compliant compiler.

### Included Tools
#### Print Bytes
This is an incredibly small and portable library for printing out hexadecimal
byte representations of all the basic C types. The general purpose function
show_bytes can be used for any data structure, in fact, and it is simple to
extend this library to support your needs. For implementation and use details,
see the header file. A small test script is included.
